# website-development-boilerplate
This boilerplate consists of all the tools needed to build a great website rapidly.

## Frameworks
It uses a [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS framework. 
I've decided to use it because of its simplicity and reliability.

## Preprocessors
There's <b>Stylus lang</b> to preprocess CSS and <b>Pug lang</b> to preprocess HTML.
To build them from the 'src' folder you need to use
```
gulp
```
command.

## Addons
- [Smoothscroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)
- [Scrollreveal](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal)
- 'Return to the top' button, which appears automatically after a short scroll.
